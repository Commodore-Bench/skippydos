JiffyDOS KERNAL clone for the Vic 20. 

This project was developed from June 6th 2011 to September 21st 2012. 
The only remaining bug I'm aware of is that they key-combination of CTRL+S does not pause a BASIC or directory listing.

Holding the CTRL key upon boot will force initialization of BASIC pointers and VIC registers to the values of an unexpanded machine.
